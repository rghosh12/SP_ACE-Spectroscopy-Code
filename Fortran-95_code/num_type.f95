!    This module contains the kind of number employed in SP_Ace.
!
!    It is part of the program SP_Ace, which derives stellar parameters, 
!    such as gravity, temperature, and element abundances from optical
!    stellar spectra, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) 
!    and 1D stellar atmosphere models.
